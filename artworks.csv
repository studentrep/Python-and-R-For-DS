It is possible that this is Octavie Josephine Macedo-Carvalho (1833–1909; née Marchand). She was the mistress of the important art dealer and collector George Aloysius Lucas (1824–1909), who moved to Paris in 1857. He maintained her apartment across the hall from his own, and the two shared a servant. Reportedly, cooking for both households was done in Lucas’s apartment, as Carvalho’s kitchen was stuffed with Lucas’s art collection. Therefore, it is possible that someone knew the picture was in Carvalho’s apartment but never made the connection to George A. Lucas. See Holly Selby and James Bock, “Lucas’ Will, The Fight over George A. Lucas Collection Comes Down to One Question: Does the Lucas art belong in Baltimore forever?

In addition to assembling his own significant collection of Manet prints, Lucas helped Samuel P. Avery (1822–1904) and William T. Walters (1820–1894) form their collections. Avery amassed a collection of 17,775 etchings and lithographs representing 978 artists, many of them French, and gave his collection of prints to the New York Public Library in 1900. Following his death in 1894, Walters bequeathed bequeathed his extensive collection to his son, Henry Walters, who established the Walters Art Gallery, now called The Walters Art Museum, in Baltimore, Maryland.].

In spring 1910 Pellerin sold much of his Manet collection to a consortium of art dealers comprised of Bernheim-Jeune and Durand-Ruel, both in Paris, and Paul Cassirer, in Berlin. See Julius Meier-Graefe, Kunst ist nicht für Kunstgeschichte da: Briefe und Dokumente, ed. Catherine Krahmer (Wallstein, 2001), p. 374. In June of that year, Bernheim-Jeune exhibited thirty-five works by Manet from the Pellerin collection. See Bernheim-Jeune, Manet: Trente-cinq tableaux de la collection Pellerin (Paris, 1910). This pastel was not included, but another pastel portrait, L’Homme Blond (Duret no. 75) was shown.
